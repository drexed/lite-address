## Usage

Parsing an address will return a `Lite::Address::Format` object which responds to the
methods below (check the class to see more). If an address cannot be parsed then nil
will be returned, but partial matches can be returned. All addresses will try to be
normalized to return a predictable pattern.

```
address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC, 20500")
address.street        #=> Pennsylvania
address.number        #=> 1600
address.postal_code   #=> 20500
address.city          #=> Washington
address.state         #=> DC
address.state_name    #=> District of Columbia
address.street_type   #=> Ave
address.intersection? #=> false

address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("1600 Pennsylvania Ave")
address.street  #=> Pennsylvania
address.number  #=> 1600
address.state   #=> nil

address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("5904 Richmond Hwy Ste 340 Alexandria VA 22303-1864")
address.postal_code_ext #=> 1846

address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("5904 Richmond Hwy Ste 340 Alexandria VA 223031864")
address.postal_code_ext #=> 1846
```

To parse address for non US based addresses just pass a corresponding country code.

```
address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("1 Blue Jays Way, Toronto, ON M5V 1J1, Canada", country_code: "CA")
address.street        #=> Blue Jays
address.number        #=> 1
address.state_name    #=> Ontario
...
```

## Formatting

A formatted can be returned to as a whole or in parts of simple strings.

```
address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC, 20500")
address.to_s         #=> 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC 20500
address.to_s(:line1) #=> 1600 Pennsylvania Ave
address.to_s(:line2) #=> Washington, DC 20500
```

You can also format strings to the proper country mail format.

```
address = Lite::Address::Parse.parse("1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC, 20500")
address.to_snail                    #=> 1600 Pennsylvania Ave,
                                        Washington, DC 20500

address.to_snail(name: 'John Doe')  #=> John Doe
                                        1600 Pennsylvania Ave,
                                        Washington, DC 20500
```
